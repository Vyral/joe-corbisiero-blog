Today I’m spotlighting one of my favorite restaurants in the Little Italy neighborhood: Civico 1845. I ate here recently, and I must say, the food blew my mind! Best of all, they have an entire menu dedicated to vegans.
<br>
<br>**Zio Vincenzo opened Civico 1845 in June of 2015, and has been serving customers from all over the country ever since then**. He says that it’s been busy since the day they opened and hasn’t slowed down yet.
<br>
<br>As someone that grew up with authentic Italian food, I must say that I’m very picky when it comes to what I like. However, the food at Civico 1845 totally blew me away.
<br>
<br>Zio Vincenzo says that what sets his restaurant’s food apart is the fact that **everything they make is fresh**. The pasta is made from scratch and even the fish is delivered fresh every week. I’ve also noticed that the menu is written in perfect Italian, a rarity even at most other Italian restaurants!
<br>
<br>Keep an eye out for part two of our series featuring Civico 1845, where I’ll be talking to Chef Pietro, part-owner of the restaurant and the chef for the vegan menu.
