It’s another beautiful sunny day in San Diego and our own Joe Corbisiero is back for another episode in our “A Slice of Little Italy” series. Today Joe is at iDessert, one of the newest and best dessert shops in the city. **iDessert is the creation of world-renowned pastry chef Jean- Philippe Maury**, who made a name for himself in Las Vegas as an executive pastry chef and has appeared on TV programs like *The Next Iron Chef*and* Fabulous Cakes*.

The concept of iDessert was to create an experience where customers can build their own dessert without actually having to make it themselves. The concept is quite simple in practice:

**You are given a tablet that you use to build a dessert**. You choose all of your ingredients. You then choose your meringue shell, all of which are made in-house and come in 15 different flavors. Next, you can add cream to coat the inside of the shell to break the sugar. After that, you can pick your flavor of gelato or sorbet to put inside. You can add a crunch of nuts or Oreos, in addition to fresh fruit toppings like peaches or cherries. Finally, you top it with sauce, which comes in a little ball dispenser.&nbsp;

In addition to that dish, you can also build your own sundae or crepe. **The desserts range in price from around $5 to $10** and are very affordable for the quality of ingredients used—not to mention the value of the experience in eating a great dessert like this. Everything is made from scratch, everything is fresh, and this place is the real deal. **Quality is their first priority, then comes inventiveness**.&nbsp;

iDessert is located at 1609 India St., is open every day from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and until midnight on Friday and Saturday. Thanks to Jean Felipe for sitting down to talk with us and sharing your latest creation. If you get the chance, you absolutely need to come down here and check this place out.

If you have any questions about iDessert, Little Italy, or anything real estate-related, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
