I have three secrets to help you get your home sold for top dollar that I wanted to let you in on.

1. <div><strong>Showcase your home's best features</strong>. This is so important! You want to showcase your home with professional-quality photos and video, including drone video and interior video for certain kinds of properties. You should also consider staging your home. If you call a stager or two for some information, you might be able to do this part on your own, but you don't want to skip out on the professional photographs. The whole package would cost you between $3,000 and $5,000, but if you call us, it's free.</div>
2. <div><strong>Maximize your online presence</strong>. Did you know that 90% of home buyers search online for their home? Nearly 50% of them find their own home online, too. It's crucial to have a presence on all the real estate websites you can. We have a deal with Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com that allows us to showcase homes on page one, so you'll be seen right away on all these top websites. I can't tell you how much this would cost you to do on your own, but it cost us a lot of money! It's just one more cost you won't have to spend if you work with us.</div>
3. <div><strong>Pricing strategy and negotiation</strong>. You don't want to leave any money on the table. It's not just about coming up with an estimate&ndash;we do deep research to find the right price to list at. We look at what's available right now, who is competing against your property, what has sold in the last six months, and what is pending. Then we look at the condition of your property to determine what we can do to improve it. Only then do we come up with a price.</div>
