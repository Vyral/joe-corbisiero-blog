I recently sat down with some of the top minds in real estate on the West Coasts to debate about the most important topics in the world of real estate today. We focused on two major topics: Vacation rentals and the risk level associated with them, and when the best time is to sell your San Diego home. Our opinions varied on a lot of things within these topics, but there were definitely some things we agreed on. When it comes to vacation rentals, we talked about whether or not you should buy now or wait until the dust settles with potential law changes on the horizon. Much of it depends on whether you can use it as a rental short-term of long-term. When it comes to selling your home, we discussed whether you should only sell if you have to. One thing we know is that prices will go up and up, but a homeowner's needs will always be the first priority.

That's just a taste of this panel discussion we had on Smarter San Diego. You really need to see it all to get all the answers.
