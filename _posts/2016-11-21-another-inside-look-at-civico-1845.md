For the second part of our spotlight on Civico, we're taking with Pietro Gallo who is the chef and creator of the vegan menu here at the restaurant. He's going to clue us in on some secrets they have here at Civico 1845.

The owners found our area's little Italy, decided it would be a great spot for a restaurant, and the rest is history. I personally found Civico a few months ago while dining out with a friend who is vegan. **My friend knew Civico had a vegan menu, so we tried a couple things out, and I was amazed**!

Pietro Gallo says Civico is the only vegan Italian restaurant in San Diego and probably the only one in California. Coming up with the idea of a vegan menu was easy for [name] because he is vegan himself. Since he works and east here, he approached his business partner about having an entirely vegan menu instead of just a few items. Now, the menu has about 17 vegan items on it.

The mushroom calamari Â and vegan 'meatballs' are some of the most popular items on the menu, all of which are made from scratch. The pasta is homemade and fresh, just like the desserts. Since we live a healthy lifestyle here in San Diego, I think it's so important to have options like these. Pietro Gallo says that 30% of his customers are going vegan!

As an Italian, I can't recommend Civico 1845 enough. It's definitely worth a try.

As always, if you have any questions for me, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
