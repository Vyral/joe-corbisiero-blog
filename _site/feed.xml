        <title>The Latest Trends in the San Diego Real Estate Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lG8CxXZlyfo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, a lot of people have asked, “Are we in a buyer’s or seller’s market?” I want to answer that question and give you a market update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you are in a buyer’s or seller’s market depends on what price point you are in. If you are looking for homes between $200,000 and $750,000, you would be in a seller’s market. There is huge demand in this price point, but not much inventory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Certain price points are in a seller’s market and others are in a buyer’s market.%20localhost:4000/the-latest-trends-in-the-san-diego-real-estate-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Certain price points are in a seller’s market and others are in a buyer’s market.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, homes priced over $1.25 million are in a buyer’s market because there is significantly more inventory than demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for our market overall, the number of homes on the market has gone up 4% in the last month. On the other end of the spectrum, the number of homes coming off the market, pending sales, are up 18%. As a result, we have a shortage of inventory available on the market. In fact, our inventory levels are down 18% from this time last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking of selling your home, now would be a great time to get on the market and cash out. If you have any questions about selling or buying a home in this market, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;
